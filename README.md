## Installation

If using with Pants, add this to your `pants.toml`:

```toml
[GLOBAL]
backend_packages2.add = ["pants.backend.python.lint.flake8"]

[flake8]
extra_requirements.add = ["flake8-pantsbuild"]
```

If using Flake8 without Pants, install with:

```bash
$ pip install flake8-pantsbuild
```

### Supported Python versions

This plugin works with Python 3.6+.

If you need support for Python 2.7 or Python 3.5, install `flake8-pantsbuild==1.*` and refer to the README at https://github.com/pantsbuild/flake8-pantsbuild/blob/1.x/README.md.

## Usage

If using with Pants, run `./pants lint file.py` as usual.

If using without Pants, run `flake8 file.py` [as usual](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/invocation.html).

## Error Codes

| Error code | Description                                                     | Notes                |
|:----------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------:|:--------------------:|
| PB10       | Using class attribute that breaks inheritance                   |                      |
| PB11       | Using a constant on the left-hand side of a logical operator    |                      |
| PB12       | Using a constant on the right-hand side of an and operator      |                      |
| PB13       | Using `open` without a `with` statement (context manager)       |                      |
| PB20       | Check for 2-space indentation                                   | Disabled by default¹ |
| PB30       | Using slashes instead of parentheses for line continuation      | Disabled by default² |

¹ To enable the `PB20` indentation lint, set `--enable-extensions=PB20`. You'll need to disable `E111` (check for 4-space indentation) via `--extend-ignore=E111`. You'll likely want to disable `E121`, `E124`, `E125`, `E127`, and `E128` as well.

² To enable the `PB30` trailing slash lint, set `--enable-extensions=PB30`.

## Migrating from `lint.pythonstyle` to `flake8`

`lint.pythonstyle` was a custom Pants task from the `pants.contrib.python.checks` plugin that behaved like Flake8, but was generally inferior to the more popular Flake8.

### Differences between the tools 

Pants' `lint.pythonstyle` task runs `pycodestyle` and `pyflakes`, in addition to providing several custom lints. 

In contrast, Flake8 runs `pycodestyle` and `pyflakes`, but it also uses `mccabe` to check for complex sections of code and it [adds its own lints](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/error-codes.html). Flake8 does not have any of the custom `lint.pythonstyle` lints by default, but the [below table](#alternatives-to-custom-lints) shows how to keep any of these lints you'd like.

Flake8 has hundreds of plugins that you may easily add to Pants. See [Awesome Flake8 Extensions](https://github.com/DmytroLitvinov/awesome-flake8-extensions) for a curated list of plugins.

### Steps to migrate

First, follow the [installation instructions](#installation) to hook up Flake8 with Pants. Then, disable `lint.pythonstyle` by removing `pants.contrib.python.checks` from your `pants.toml`.

Then, run Flake8 by running `./pants lint file.py` (see [Usage](#usage)).

The first time you run `./pants lint` , you will likely have several errors due to its differences with `lint.pythonstyle`. We recommend starting by [disabling](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/violations.html) those errors in a [`.flake8` config file](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/configuration.html). Add this to your `pants.toml` to ensure Pants uses the config:

```toml
[flake8]
config = "path/to/.flake8"
```

If you want to keep any of the custom lints from `lint.pythonstyle`, refer to the below table. You will need to install additional plugins by adding this to your `pants.toml`:

```toml
[flake8]
extra_requirements.add = [
  "flake8-pantsbuild",
  "pep8-naming",
  "flake8-import-order",
  # and so on...
]
```

¹ This lint is disabled by default. See the above section [`Error Codes`](#error-codes) for instructions on how to enable this lint.

² To use `isort` with Pants, set `backend_packages2.add = ["pants.backend.python.lint.isort"]` in your `pants.toml`.

³ The `PB6*` lints are only available in the `1.x` release series for this plugin because `2.x` drops support for Python 2. Please refer to the README at https://github.com/pantsbuild/flake8-pantsbuild/blob/1.x/README.md#error-codes for instructions on how to use this plugin.

## Development

We use [tox](https://testrun.org/tox/en/latest/) for test automation. To run the test suite, invoke tox:

```bash
$ tox
```

You may run certain environments with `tox -e` (run `tox -a` to see all options):

```bash
$ tox -e format-run
$ tox -e py36
```

You may also manually test by building a [PEX](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex) with this plugin, as follows:

```bash
$ pex flake8 . --entry-point flake8 --output-file flake8.pex
$ vim example.py  # add whatever content you want
$ ./flake.pex example.py
```
